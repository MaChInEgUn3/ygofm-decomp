# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories — matching decompilation

Byte-exact recompilation of `SLUS_014.11`. **Not** a reimplementation: every
function must assemble to the retail bytes. `DECISIONS.md` in this directory is the
full reference and is long; this file is the operational minimum — read it
first, then reach for DECISIONS.md when you need the reasoning behind a rule.

## Verify everything with the build

```
.venv/bin/python tools_src/build.py && echo GREEN
```
It exits non-zero on any failure, so **check the exit status, not the last
lines of output**. Piping it through `tail -2` reads as green when the build
died early, because the last thing printed is then the function count. Two
commits in this project went in red that way, one of them the commit that
noticed the first.
sha1 `84747e64f6da8e764206ec203e489acf8c9dcf7d`. Always the project `.venv`,
never a bare `pip install` — installing globally once broke another tool's pins.

## Toolchain: PsyQ 4.5 (gcc 2.8.1, aspsx 2.79)

Not 4.6. That was assumed for the project's first 219 functions and produced a
byte-identical build anyway, because most functions are too small for the two
versions to differ. `YGOFM_PSYQ=46` selects 4.6 for comparison. `tools/` is
gitignored and must be re-fetched per machine.

## Adding a function

Write `src/func_XXXXXXXX.c` and rebuild; placement is automatic. Get candidates
from `tools_src/candidates.py`, and from `tools_src/siblings.py`, which pairs
each unmatched candidate with the decompiled function it most resembles. Run
siblings at 0.70, not 0.90 — the loose end of that list is as good as the tight
end, and skip the `[PARKED]` rows, which are sorted last for a measured reason.

`candidates.py` no longer hides anything as "cannot match": four drop rules
have been retracted in turn, each after being measured, and each was hiding
functions that matched. It tags instead. Two tags matter:
- **`dup-%hi`** — retail materialised one address twice. Try
  `-mno-split-addresses` **first**; all 96 instances in the binary are the bare
  form and an alias makes them worse. A quarter of them also want a hoisted
  split address in the same unit and cannot have both.
- **`lib-call`** — calls a PsyQ library function. An implicit declaration is
  enough; do not write a prototype unless a float or struct is involved.

**When it does not match, work in this order.** Each step makes the next
meaningful, and skipping to the last one wastes hours:

1. **Instruction count right?** Nothing else is diagnostic until it is. If a
   function is the wrong size, remove it before reading the rest of the report —
   the linker script is regenerated from object sizes, so one wrong size can
   move functions placed *earlier* as well as later.
2. **Read/declaration order.** The most common single fix here. Declaration
   order controls which callee-saved register a value gets, where a constant is
   materialised, whether an address is folded, and whether an initialiser
   competes with the prologue. Specific shape: **a table read through a local
   declared before anything else has its address materialised before anything
   else** — that is what put func_80019A60's `la` ahead of the argument swap.
   It only works if the local replaces *every* reference to the symbol;
   a local that merely names one operand stays live and costs a register
   everywhere (func_8005A8C4, parked). The same local is also what stops
   cc1psx folding the *first* reference's constant offset into the base —
   without it func_800300C8 gets `%lo(D_800EB15C+60)` and every later offset
   is 60 too small.
   The mirror of the two-names rule (func_8004318C, two multiplies of one
   value need two names): **two unrelated values must not share one name.**
   Reusing a `y` for both halfword results in func_800300C8 swapped a
   `$v0`/`$v1` pair; splitting it into `y` and `z` was 11 differences to 7.
3. **Branch polarity and loop form.** cc1psx emits the fall-through for the
   branch written as not-taken — look at which path retail falls into. But check
   the **loop statement first**, because it decides block layout on its own:
   - a backward unconditional `j` means the loop was *not* rotated — write
     `while (1)` with the exit inside, never `while (cond)`. 85 in-scope
     functions have that `j`;
   - a *forward* `j` into the loop's bottom test is the **unrotated** `while`:
     gcc did not copy the header, and no `while`/`do` spelling reproduces it.
     Write `goto test;` at the top with the test at the bottom (func_8003BC40).
     Once you do, gcc tail-merges the two copies of the test's own load into
     the test block; put a statement *after* that load in the advance block
     (`e++; v = *e; idx++;`, not `e++; idx++; v = *e;`) and the merge cannot
     fire. That was 42 differences to 28;
   - an out-of-line arm the target places **before** the loop body is a label
     the source reached with a `goto`, not an `else` — no polarity edit moves
     a block across the loop head;
   - a rotated `for` puts an interior `return` **inline**, between the test and
     the loop-back; an explicit `do`/`while` puts it after the loop-back. Same
     loop, different layout, and no polarity edit reaches across the difference.
4. **Which operand receives the result?** `addu $a1,$a1,$v1` and
   `addu $v0,$v0,$a1` compute the same sum into different registers. Swapping the
   operands of a `+` changes nothing. `a += b;` makes `a` the destination *and*
   the first operand; `t = a + b;` into a fresh variable keeps the tree order.
   Pick by which one retail shows — this unparked four functions in one direction
   and matched `func_80035748` in the other.
   Related, same pass: an expression the target recomputes in several blocks was
   **not** a variable in the source. gcc 2.8 has no global CSE, so write it inline
   in each block. Also here: `tbl[i + K]` emits `addu index,base` and
   `(tbl + i)[K]` emits `addu base,index` — same address, opposite operands.
   And the order of two increments in one `for` clause decides which is
   available to fill a load-delay slot at the top of the body:
   `for (i = 0; i < 10; p++, i++)` matched func_80021480 where `i++, p++`
   left a stray `nop` and 39 differences.
5. **Which test is written first**, when the target has more exit blocks than
   you produce. `if (x == 0) return 0;` then the body, versus the body under
   `if (x != 0)` with `return 0` after it, are *different layouts*: the first
   keeps both exits, the second gets cross-jumped into one with the value in a
   delay slot. Rule of thumb: whichever condition the target **branches out on**
   is the one to write first. Confirmed on `func_80033500` and `func_800440B4`.
6. **Count materialisations** of each value: one per write in the source. One
   `subu` reached by two paths means one `return`; two identical constants mean
   two `return`s; a value written at a join and copied to `$v0` at one exit is
   an accumulator variable. Same counting applies to *stores*: a store in a
   `j`'s delay slot that the join block repeats is a genuine second store, not
   a delay-slot copy of the join (gcc only copies a target instruction with the
   branch moved to target+4). The confirming tell is a constant the join
   consumes but each predecessor materialises for itself — func_800402A0.
   Writing that store once per arm instead costs 18 differences.
7. **Then** the flags — `tools_src/sweep_try.py` first, `sweep_flags.py` to
   confirm. Do not leave this to last when the target shows a **loop counting
   the other way**: gcc reverses a counted loop whose counter is dead after it,
   and `-O1` is sometimes the only thing that stops it (func_80047A68, 23
   differences to 6). If retail's loop comparison is *unsigned*, try a `u32`
   counter before reaching for a flag (func_800494F4). Also flags, not source:
   a **load hoisted above a store to a different global** to fill its own
   load-delay slot is `-fno-schedule-insns` (func_80014A5C, the first user).
   `volatile` does not stop that hoist on either object — gcc 2.8 moves a load
   across a volatile store and moves a volatile load too.

**Stop and park** when the only remaining difference is which register holds a
value, or when the target has more duplicated tails than you produce. Record the
name in `docs/PARKED.txt` with its class **and keep the candidate in
`parked/<func>.c`**.

Before parking on "one register differs", check whether a **call** separates the
definitions of the two values, and if it does, try moving one definition across
it. That took `func_80022FF0` from seven differences to a match, and it changes
nothing else in the output, which is why it hides so well. **Observed once.**
Probed afterwards on every parked candidate with a call in it and it moved none
of them, so treat it as one more thing to try, not as a rule — and note that most
"one register differs" parks are `$v0`/`$v1` inside a single basic block, where
there is no call to move anything across.

The third class this list used to name — the target keeping two comparisons
where cc1psx folds a range check — **is not closed**. The fold happens on the
`&&`; write it as nested `if`s and both comparisons survive.

Before parking anything, run `tools_src/sweep_try.py <func>`. It is the flag
sweep through try_func rather than a full build per combination, so it costs
seconds instead of half an hour, and two functions were parked for hours today
on a combination that had been in the table for weeks.

## Types and declarations

- Every global once in `include/variables.h`, every cross-file function in
  `include/functions.h`. Two files disagreeing breaks matching far away.
- **A `u8` parameter is only right when the target masks at the call site.**
  The narrowness usually belongs to the store inside the callee, which
  truncates anyway. Widening `func_80040410`'s second parameter to `s32` left
  the callee and its other caller byte-identical and removed the `andi` that
  was blocking func_80021480. Re-run try_func over every decompiled caller
  when you change one — same hazard as adding a prototype.
- **Before adding a prototype, `ls src/<callee>.c`.** Three times in one session
  a callee was already decompiled with a different signature, and the added
  prototype made the *existing* file stop compiling. `grep -rn <callee> src/`
  finds the callers that also need updating.
- **Hold values in the widest natural type; cast at the point of use.** A narrow
  type inside a computation costs an `andi` or a sign-extend — this has bitten
  parameters, return values, locals and loop counters. It also changes
  *comparisons*: a `u8` local compares in QImode and a `u16` local in HImode,
  and both are **unsigned**, so `u8 v = p[i]; if (v >= 0xB)` gives `sltiu` where
  the same byte in an `s32` gives retail's `slti`.
- The reverse also happens: a narrow **return type** is sometimes the whole
  function. `u16 func(s32 arg0)` holds the value unmasked and puts the `andi` at
  the return, which is why retail copies the argument to `$v0` before clobbering
  `$a0` with the test — func_80047C50.
- And a narrow **local** can be the whole function without changing one
  instruction. `s8 v = p[0x18];` matched func_80027060 where
  `s32 v = (s8)p[0x18];` gave 18 differences — same instructions, same order,
  every register in the block rotated by one, because the redundant cast is a
  pseudo born before the load's own. **When the only difference left is that a
  whole block's registers are shifted by one, look for a pseudo that should not
  exist**; a cast that changes no instruction is the commonest source.
- `common.h` does not define `NULL`. Write `(u8 *)0`.
- Scalar vs unsized array is a codegen choice, and the mechanism is a size hint.
  Three addressing forms can appear in one function; pick each by declaration:
  - **scalar** — cc1psx knows the size, treats it as small data and emits
    `%gp_rel($gp)` itself. The assembler's `-G` never enters into it.
  - **unsized array** — not small, so cc1psx emits an explicit `%hi`/`%lo` pair
    into an ordinary register.
  - **unsized array + `-mno-split-addresses`** — cc1psx emits the bare symbol and
    the *assembler* expands it: through the destination register for a load,
    through `$at` for a store, which has no spare register. `lui $at` in the
    target means this one.
  A per-file `#ifdef SYM_IS_SCALAR` guard in `variables.h` lets two functions
  disagree about the same symbol. The tell for the third form is `lui $r,%hi(s)`
  with the memory op through the **same** `$r`; but read it in one direction
  only — a *separate* temp is always cc1psx's own pair, while one register can
  be either (func_80022618 splits its own pair across a delay slot using one
  register).
- **`volatile` when the function's point is re-reading.** gcc commons a repeated
  read with the one in the entry guard and then propagates the value, which
  deletes the test: func_8005C5D4's spin loop needs it, and func_80058E1C needs
  a second *name* for the same reason where volatile would be wrong.
- `config/symbol_aliases.txt` gives an address a second name, for when retail
  materialises it twice inside one basic block. Needs a `-G0` assembler to be
  worth anything.

## Two habits that cost real time when skipped

**A tool's answer only counts if it measured what you think.** Six bugs in this
project were tools reporting confidently on something they had not measured — a
stale object, an unverified flag, a crashed build read as clean. When a tool
says "no", ask whether it could have said "yes"; when it says "yes", ask whether
the run it judged completed. The cheapest way to fall into this is a **filter**:
`try_func.py ... | grep -E '<<|differing|MATCH'` prints nothing both for a clean
match and for a compile error, because the error text matches none of the three
patterns. Read try_func's last lines, not a grep of them.

**Measure before concluding.** Claims here have been wrong by 4x from reasoning
over a handful of samples. Scan the whole binary before letting a pattern
justify a decision — and then **filter the scan by scope**: anything at or above
`0x80073840`, or listed in `docs/LIBRARY_FUNCS.txt`, is PsyQ library code that
stays as assembly. `candidates.py` applies that filter; a hand-rolled grep over
`asm/` does not, and three functions were parked as matching failures before
anyone checked.

Run `tools_src/sync_count.py` before committing a batch — the count has been
typed wrong twice.
